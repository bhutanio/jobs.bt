## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Job Seeker, I want to sign up, build an AI-assisted resume, discover recent and recommended jobs, and apply easily so I can get hired. As an Employer, I want to sign up, quickly generate AI-assisted job postings, publish them, and manage applicants so I can fill roles efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am new to the site, **When** I register and choose "Job Seeker", **Then** my account is created and I land on a Job Seeker dashboard.
2. **Given** I am a Job Seeker, **When** I open the resume builder and provide my background (skills, experience, education), **Then** an editable AI-generated resume draft is created that I can review and save.
3. **Given** there are published jobs, **When** I visit the home page, **Then** I see a list of recent jobs with key details and can click through to a job detail page.
4. **Given** I am viewing a job detail, **When** I click "Apply" and confirm, **Then** my application is recorded and I receive an immediate in-app confirmation and an email receipt.
5. **Given** I have a completed profile/resume, **When** I view "Recommended for you", **Then** I see an AI-generated list of jobs sorted by relevance with controls to save or hide items.
6. **Given** I am new to the site, **When** I register and choose "Employer", **Then** my account is created and I land on an Employer dashboard.
7. **Given** I am an Employer, **When** I use the AI job generator and provide a job title, seniority, and key requirements, **Then** I receive an editable job posting draft that I can publish.
8. **Given** I have published a job, **When** I open my Employer dashboard, **Then** I can see the job's status and a list of applicants with their resumes.
9. **Given** there are no relevant jobs for my profile, **When** I open recommendations, **Then** the system explains no matches were found and suggests actions (update resume, broaden filters).
10. **Given** the AI service is unavailable, **When** I try to use AI resume or job generation, **Then** I am informed and offered a manual alternative without losing my progress.

### Edge Cases
- Duplicate sign-ups with the same email; role switching after registration is not allowed (new account required for different role).
- "Recent jobs" defined as postings from the last 30 days; always ordered by published date descending; paginate 20 per page.
- AI-generated text quality and appropriateness; user must be able to edit before publishing
- Empty states: no jobs available, no applications, no recommendations
- Privacy: resumes are visible to Employers only when included with an application; Employers cannot search or browse a resume database.
- Rate limiting: AI features limited to 5 generations per hour and 20 per day per user; application submissions limited to 10 per hour per Job Seeker; no cap on total applicants per job.

- **FR-022**: The system MUST provide a mechanism to report inappropriate job postings or AI-generated content; reports create a moderation queue; moderators review within 48 hours and may remove content; high-risk content may be temporarily limited in visibility pending review.
- **FR-023**: The system MUST capture explicit user consent before using AI assistance, label AI-generated content clearly, and store consent timestamps; AI output MUST include a disclaimer that users should review and edit before publishing.
- **FR-024**: The home page jobs list MUST load within 2 seconds at P50 and 4 seconds at P95 on a typical broadband connection.
- **FR-025**: Role changes (Job Seeker ‚Üî Employer) are not allowed after registration; users who need a different role MUST create a new account.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
