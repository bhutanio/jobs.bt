# Implementation Plan: Simple Job Site


**Branch**: `001-simple-job-site` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: `/Users/abi/Sites/jobs/specs/001-simple-job-site/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/abi/Sites/jobs/specs/001-simple-job-site/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a Laravel 12+ monolith (PHP 8.3+) with MySQL and Eloquent to deliver a simple job site: role-based signup (Job Seeker, Employer), AI-assisted resume builder and job generation, recent jobs home page and job detail, AI job matching, and role dashboards. Non-functional constraints include resume privacy, rate limiting, verification, and performance targets. Technical approach aligns with research: Fortify for auth, Spatie Permission for RBAC, DomPDF for PDFs, Bootstrap 5.3.6 + NobleUI + jQuery with Vite/SCSS, Pest for tests, Pint for formatting.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: PHP 8.3+, Laravel 12+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Laravel Fortify, Spatie Laravel Permission, barryvdh/laravel-dompdf, Bootstrap 5.3.6, NobleUI, jQuery 3.7.1, Vite, SCSS  
**Storage**: MySQL 8.x with Eloquent ORM  
**Testing**: Pest PHP  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (web), browser clients  
**Project Type**: web (single Laravel monolith)  
**Performance Goals**: Home page jobs list P50 ≤ 2s, P95 ≤ 4s  
**Constraints**: AI rate limits 5/h & 20/day per user; apps 10/h per seeker; resume privacy; role switching disallowed; phone + manual company verification  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP initial release; scope per spec FR-001..FR-025

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (web app + tests)
- Using framework directly (no unnecessary wrappers)
- Single domain model (no DTOs unless needed for export)
- Avoid Repository/UoW; use Eloquent directly

**Architecture**:
- Monolith app, no extra libraries introduced
- Contracts generated in docs only; no separate CLI
- Documentation lives under `specs/001-simple-job-site/`

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor enforced with Pest
- Contract tests before implementation
- Use SQLite in-memory for speed and MySQL in CI for integration
- Integration tests for contracts and flows
- No implementation before failing tests

**Observability**:
- Use Laravel logging with contextual user/job IDs
- Error pages and validation errors surfaced clearly

**Versioning**:
- Semantic versioning at app level post-MVP; migrations versioned via Laravel

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) but implemented as a single Laravel app repository (monolith)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
